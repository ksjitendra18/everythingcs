Sometimes there are security requirement to get the user ip address so let's see how can we get user ip while using cloudflare workers.

Please note that IP address is considered personal data so please ensure to follow the data privacy laws.

## Step 1: Setup

Let's create a new cloudflare app

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

</CodeContainer>

Now select the "Website or web app" and then select hono. For git and deploy choose on your preference.

## Step 2: Getting User Ip

Now in the src/index.ts file we will try to access the user ip.

Cloudflare workers request has the header "CF-Connecting-IP". We can access this header to get the user ip address.

<CodeContainer fileName="src/index.ts">

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) =>
  c.json({ userIP: c.req.raw.headers.get("CF-Connecting-IP") })
);

export default app;
```

</CodeContainer>

Now run the server in the remote mode.
If you run the server without remote mode then you will not get the ip address.

If you're using npm then add a new script in package.json

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

```bash
"dev:remote": "wrangler dev src/index.ts --remote",
```

</CodeContainer>

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

```bash
npm run dev:remote
#or
pnpm run dev --remote 
```

</CodeContainer>

You will get the response

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

```json
{"userIP": "xx.xx.xx.xx"}
```

</CodeContainer>

## Conclusion

So in this post we used Hono framework running cloudflare workers  to get the user ip address.
