With the introduction of Server Components we can easily perform server side pagination and searching in the Next.js app router with the help of query params so in this article we are going to see how to achieve exactly this using the Drizzle ORM.

Please refer to the [github repo](https://github.com/ksjitendra18/nextjs-pagination.git) for code reference. This works well in both Next.js 14 and 15. This tutorial is based on Next.js 14.
