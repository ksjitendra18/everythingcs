With the introduction of Server Components we can easily perform server side pagination and searching in the Next.js app router with the help of query params so in this article we are going to see how to achieve exactly this using the Drizzle ORM.

Please refer to the [github repo](https://github.com/ksjitendra18/nextjs-pagination.git) for code reference. This works well in both Next.js 14 and 15. This tutorial is based on Next.js 14.

Here is the demonstration.

## Setup

I have setup a basic Next.js app with Drizzle ORM. [Download the setup from github](https://github.com/ksjitendra18/nextjs-pagination/archive/refs/heads/starter-code.zip). Extract it in your desired folder and run `npm i` to install all the packages.

After installing create a local db or use a remote database. I am using a local mysql database.

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

  ```bash 
  mysql -u username -p # enter password 
  ```

</CodeContainer>

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

```bash 
create database paginationguide;
```

</CodeContainer>

Now create a .env.local file and add the database url.

<CodeContainer fileName="terminal">

```bash 
DB_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/paginationguide 
```

</CodeContainer>
